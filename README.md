# Data_Linkage-Classification
For this project, I will perform a data linkage on two real-world datasets and explore different classification algorithms.

# In Jupyter Notebook
## Part 1
Perform a data linkage of two real-world datasets(Amazon, Google) and assess the quality of the data linkage based on different algorithms

## Part 2
Build and assess a classification algorithm in predicting the cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast, based on particular attributes.
